Add like Netflix option to check if you are still watching, works with popular Windows media apps.

The program is responsible for monitoring whether the user falls asleep while watching a movie on programs such as VLC, Windows Media Player, Media Player Classic Home Cinema, PotPlayer, GOM Player, KMPlayer, 5KPlayer, SMPlayer, DivX Player or CyberLink PowerDVD. If any of these programs are running, the program periodically (by default every 30 minutes) pauses the movie to ask if the user is still watching. If the user clicks "OK", the movie will continue. If they don't click, it will remain paused until the user interacts with it.

Using the tray icon, the user can easily turn the program on and off, as well as change the frequency of checks.
